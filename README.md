## CarPC Event Handler
This is a Windows application I threw together to automatically put a Windows tablet to sleep when AC power is removed and keeps it awake when power is applied.

I created this on a Surface Pro 3 for a Winbook TW800 installed in the dash of my car, and I've tested it on newer devices and it seems to still be applicable today.

## Where's the code???
